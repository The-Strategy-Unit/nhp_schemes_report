# Overview

## Background

The government has committed to building more than 40 new hospitals by 2030. The New Hospital Programme (NHP), a partnership between Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS England (NHSE), aims to ensure that this new hospital infrastructure will meet the future needs of the population and that the required investment represents value for money.

Estimating future activity levels represents a critical early step in the process of scaling and designing new hospital infrastructure. The Strategy Unit (SU) has developed a Demand and Activity model to support the NHP and its stakeholders to make robust and auditable assessments of activity that hospitals may need to accommodate in the future.

## The Demand and Activity Model overview

The Demand and Activity Model takes activity at a chosen baseline year and projects into the future how activity levels might change without further action (though, importantly, assuming that past actions are sustained and scaled in line with population changes). It also allows systems to make judgements about evidence-based activity mitigations and productivity improvements that they plan to achieve (e.g. to reduce activity, lower its intensity, or divert it). From that combination of inputs, set as ranges to reflect uncertainty, the model forecasts a distribution of likely future activity. From that activity forecast, capacity requirements can then be derived.

The overall model logic is shown below (the elements in blue are currently live; the elements in orange are planned future refinements):

![](images/model_diagram.png)

In developing the modelling approach for individual hospital schemes (as opposed to whole-programme average assumptions to drive e.g. the Programme Business Case), NHP has determined which input assumptions at the current time are best determined locally (following a systematic method, using a nationally determined structure- the Demand and Activity Model- and with constructive challenge) and which nationally. Assumptions are set nationally where there is little or no reason to believe that the factor is likely to operate differentially at a local level.

This is set out below:

+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+

: National and local assumptions

## Purpose of this report

The purpose of this report is to allow the NHP to assess the breadth, ambition, certainty and credibility of trusts' mitigatable activity assumptions. These constitute the bulk of the local assumptions made by each trust during the model rollout / local elicitation exercises that have been conducted this year.

## Structure of the report

Six lines of inquiry have been identified, five of which are addressed in this initial report. The remainder (italicised) will feature in future analysis once the method has been developed.

Note that below NEE refers to the National Elicitation Exercise which was conducted in 2023 to ask subject matter experts their views on the likely reasonable ranges of change in the future for each of the sets of mitigatable activity in the model.

## Parameters in analysis

The table below provides information on all the 92 sets of mitigatable activity considered in this paper, including their grouping, activity type (i.e. inpatient admission, outpatient attendances and A&E attendances) and mitigation type (activity avoidance or efficiencies). The *Mitigatable activity* column is the full name of the activity subset, whereas the *Parameter name* column is the name of parameter within the model.

```{r mitigators_list}
mitigator_lookup |> 
  select(`Mitigatable activity` = `Strategy name`,
         `Parameter name` = `Strategy variable`,
         Grouping, 
         `Activity type`, 
         `Mitigation type` = `Mitigator type`) |> 
  gt::gt() |> 
  gt::tab_header("All mitigatable activity in analysis")

```

## Schemes in analysis

The following schemes have completed the exercise.

```{r site_list}
nhp_tagged_runs_meta |> 
  mutate(create_datetime = as.Date(ymd_hms(create_datetime)),
         run_stage = str_to_title(str_extract(run_stage, "^[^_]+"))) |> 
  left_join(trust_code_lookup, 
            by = c("dataset" = "Trust ODS Code")) |> 
  select(Trust = `Name of Trust`,
         Site = `Name of Hospital site`,
         `Trust code` = dataset,
         `Run stage` = run_stage,
         Date = create_datetime) |>

```

# Parameter-level analsyes

In the following section we present analyses for each grouping of mitigatable activity across all schemes that have submitted model runs. We consider all parameter inputs from each group and then present the analyses at the group-level for conciseness given there are 92 individual parameters.

```{r mitigator_agg_data}

n_schemes <- nrow(nhp_tagged_runs_meta)
mitigator_agg_data <- dat |> 
  filter(!is.na(value_mid)) |> 
  summarise(n = n(),
            coverage = n / n_schemes,
            avg_lo = mean(value_lo),
            avg_mid = mean(value_mid),
            avg_hi = mean(value_hi),
            avg_certainty = mean(value_range),
            nee_p10 = mean(nee_p10),
            nee_mid = mean(nee_p50),
            nee_p90 = mean(nee_p90),
            .by = c(mitigator_group, mitigator_variable))
```

## Parameter coverage

The table below shows the extent to which schemes have set assumptions to reduce mitigatable activity. This is based on the number of times parameters from a given mitigatable activity grouping were used divided by the maximum given the number of schemes.

```{r mitigator_coverage}
mitigator_group_coverage <- mitigator_agg_data |> 
  group_by(mitigator_group) |> 
  summarise(mitigators_in_group = n(),
            incidence = sum(n),
            max_incidence = mitigators_in_group * n_schemes) |> 
  janitor::adorn_totals(name = "All groups") |> 
  mutate(coverage = incidence / max_incidence) 

mitigator_group_coverage |> 
  mutate(coverage=scales::percent(coverage, accuracy=0.1)) |> 
  gt::gt() |> 
  gt::tab_header("Coverage of mitigatable activity groups across schemes") |>
  gt::cols_label(mitigator_group = "Grouping",
                 mitigators_in_group = "Number of parameters in group",
                 incidence = "Incidence across schemes",
                 max_incidence = "Max incidence across schemes",
                 coverage = "Coverage across schemes")
 
  
```

## Scheme ambition

Next, we assess the relative ambition of the assumptions that schemes have set to reduce mitigatable activity. We categorise the schemes' inputs into three groups: low ambition (less than a 10% reduction), medium ambition (a 10% to one third reduction), and high ambition (reduction of one third or more).

The chart shows, for each group, the proportion of scheme inputs which fall into each of these thresholds. We can see that across all parameter selections 96 (10.6%) of scheme inputs were high ambition, 438 (48.2%) were medium ambition, and 375 (41.3%) were low ambition.

```{r mitigator_ambition}
mitigator_ambition_by_group <- dat |> 
  filter(!(is.na(value_mid))) |> 
  mutate(
    mitigator_ambition = case_when(
      value_mid > 0.9 ~ "low",
      value_mid > (2/3) ~ "med",
      value_mid <= (2/3) ~ "high",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_)) |> 
  count(mitigator_group, mitigator_ambition) 

mitigator_ambition_total <- dat |> 
  filter(!(is.na(value_mid))) |> 
  mutate(
    mitigator_ambition = case_when(
      value_mid > 0.9 ~ "low",
      value_mid > (2/3) ~ "med",
      value_mid <= (2/3) ~ "high",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_)) |> 
  count(mitigator_ambition) |> 
  mutate(mitigator_group = "All mitigators")

mitigator_ambition_final <- bind_rows(mitigator_ambition_by_group, mitigator_ambition_total)


mitigator_ambition_final |> 
  group_by(mitigator_group) |> 
  mutate(p = n / sum(n)) |> 
  mutate(mitigator_ambition = factor(mitigator_ambition,
                                     levels = c("high", "med", "low"))) |> 
  ggplot(aes(y=mitigator_group, x=p, fill=mitigator_ambition)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(n, "\n (", scales::percent(p, accuracy=0.1),")")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size=2) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Mitigator ambition",
                      labels = c("High", "Medium", "Low")) +
  xlab("Proportion") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  ggtitle("Scheme ambition") +
  NHSRtheme::theme_nhs()+
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=7),
        legend.text = element_text(size=12),
        plot.title = element_text(size=18),
        legend)
```

## Relative certainty

Estimating the extent to which mitigable activity might be reduced in the future is an inherently difficult process. As such, we ask schemes to express their plans to reduce activity in the form on uncertainty interval. A narrow range suggests that schemes are confident about the proportion of that activity can be mitigated, a wider range indicates greater uncertainty.

When assessing scheme certainty, we categorise scheme inputs into three groups: high certainty (an input range less than 0.05, including point estimates), medium certainty (an input range from 0.05 to 0.15), and low certainty (an input range of 0.15 and above).

The chart below indicates that, across all groups, 268 (29.5%) of scheme inputs were believed by schemes to be highly certain, 316 (34.8%) were believed to be medium certainty, and 325 (35.8%) were believed to be low certainty.

```{r mitigator_certainty}
mitigator_certainty_by_group <- dat |> 
  filter(!(is.na(value_mid))) |> 
  mutate(
    mitigator_certainty = case_when(
      value_range < 0.05 ~ "high",
      value_range < 0.15 ~ "med",
      value_range >= 0.15 ~ "low",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_)) |> 
  count(mitigator_group, mitigator_certainty) 


mitigator_certainty_total <- dat |> 
  filter(!(is.na(value_mid))) |> 
  mutate(
    mitigator_certainty = case_when(
      value_range < 0.05 ~ "high",
      value_range < 0.15 ~ "med",
      value_range >= 0.15 ~ "low",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_)) |> 
  count(mitigator_certainty) |> 
  mutate(mitigator_group = "All mitigators")

mitigator_certainty_final <- bind_rows(mitigator_certainty_by_group, mitigator_certainty_total)

mitigator_certainty_final |> 
  group_by(mitigator_group) |> 
  mutate(p = n / sum(n)) |> 
  mutate(mitigator_certainty = factor(mitigator_certainty,
                                      levels = c("high", "med", "low"))) |> 
  ggplot(aes(y=mitigator_group, x=p, fill=mitigator_certainty)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(n, "\n (", scales::percent(p, accuracy=0.1),")")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 2) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Mitigator certainty",
                      labels = c("High", "Medium", "Low")) +
  xlab("Proportion") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  ggtitle("Scheme certainty") +
  NHSRtheme::theme_nhs()+
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=7),
        legend.text = element_text(size=12),
        plot.title = element_text(size=18)) 

```

## Credibility of scheme assumptions: (1) comparison with national expert opinions

The table below compares the assumptions that schemes have set with those provided by experts as part of the National Expert Opinion Elicitation exercise. The comparisons are made at the mid-point of the uncertainty intervals in both cases, indicating, on average, whether schemes were more or less ambitious than experts' opinions.

It indicates that, across all parameter selections, 152 (16.7%) were as or more ambitious than the NEE mid-point, and 663 (72.9%) were less ambitious, with the remainder (94,10.3%) not being covered in the NEE exercise.

```{r nee_credibility}
nee_credibility <- dat |> 
  filter(!is.na(value_mid)) |> 
  mutate(nee_diff = case_when(value_mid > nee_p50 ~ ">NEE",
                              value_mid <= nee_p50 ~ "<=NEE",
                              TRUE ~ "NEE_missing")) 

nee_credibility_group <- nee_credibility |> 
  count(mitigator_group, nee_diff)

nee_credibility_total <- nee_credibility |> 
  count(nee_diff) |> 
  mutate(mitigator_group="All mitigators")

nee_credibility_final <- bind_rows(nee_credibility_group,
                                   nee_credibility_total)

                      labels = c("As or more ambitious", "Less ambitious", "No NEE value")) +

        legend.text = element_text(size=12),
        plot.title = element_text(size=18)) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow=2))
```

## Credibility of scheme assumptions: (2) taking account of scheme position at baseline

We might expect that scheme's would set more ambitious activity reduction assumptions when they have comparatively high levels of mitigatable activity at baseline (i.e. a greater opportunity to reduce activity). The chart below indicates the extent of this relationship. For each grouping of mitigatable activity, we count the numbers of parameter inputs whose correlation to scheme baseline position fall into the following thresholds:

-   Strongly negative: less than -2/3
-   Moderately negative: -2/3 to -1/3
-   Weakly negative or positive: -1/3 and above

Given the expectation that schemes might be more ambitious given a higher baseline, we would expect a negative correlation between the schemes' baseline position and their parameter inputs (given a lower figure indicates a more ambitious assumption).

The plot below indicates that across all parameter selections, 53 (58.9%) had a weakly negative or positive correlation to baseline position, 29 (32.2%) a moderately negative, and 8 (8.9%) a strongly negative. There were 2 parameters missing from the baseline data.

<!-- ## Credibility given trust time series -->

<!-- When considering the trend comparison for each mitigator, we compare the yearly change in the 5 years leading to the schemes' baselines (so currently between 2015-16 and 2019-20 for all) and the implied yearly change from their inputs. Then for each mitigator we calculate the correlation between these two values for all the schemes having selected the mitigator. In this case we might expect a broadly negative correlation given that the more the activity was growing, the more ambitious we would expect the scheme to be, i.e. the lower the input value. -->

<!-- Similarly to the baseline comparison above, for each mitigator group, we count the numbers of mitigators whose correlations fall into the following thresholds: -->

<!-- -   Strongly negative: less than -2/3 -->

<!-- -   Moderately negative: -2/3 to -1/3 -->

<!-- -   Weakly negative: -1/3 to 0 -->

## More or less ambitious than other participating schemes (average over all parameters)

Below, for each scheme, we can see the average ambition over its selected parameters in descending order. Note that the lower the number, the more ambitious the given scheme has been in its selections given that the ambition is a reduction in the activity in scope of the parameters.

```{r mitigator_ambition_by_scheme}

## More or less certain than other participating schemes (average over all parameters)

Below we can see the average parameter certainty by scheme. This is calculated as the average range between the p10 and p90 provided for parameters. This is presented in descending order of certainty, i.e. ascending order of average range.

```{r mitigator_certainty_by_scheme}

           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")))
```

## More or less ambitious than NEE (proportion over all parameter assumptions)

Below we can see proportion of each scheme's inputs that are as or more ambitious than the NEE value for that scheme. This is presented in descending order.

```{r nee_comparison_by_scheme}

# Discussion

## Summary of key findings

### Parameter coverage

-   Across mitigatable activity groups, coverage of parameters ranges from 51.8% (*Emergency department and acute medicine activity*) to 58.4% (*Planned medical activity (adult)*). <!-- -   Both Frimley and Leighton have selected amongst the fewest parameters of all schemes (34 and 25, respectively). This contrasts to PAH and Hinchingbrooke which have both selected 84. --> <!-- -   Hinchingbrooke has selected the joint most parameters (84) of all schemes. West Suffolk has selected the least of the four schemes (58) but is still in the middle position of all schemes (9th out of 17). -->
-   Hillingdon has selected the 6th fewest parameters of all schemes, having selected 35 of the 92 parameters. This compares to 84 that both Hinchingbrooke and PAH have set.

### Parameter ambition

-   *Planned surgical activity (adult)* contains the largest proportion of high ambition assumptions (52, 21.0%), whilst *Hospital activity amenable to psychiatric liaison and community psychiatry* contains the largest proportion of low ambition assumptions (18, 47.4%). <!-- -   Leighton’s average ambition amongst its parameters is in the top half of all schemes at 0.81 whilst Frimley has the fourth lowest ambition of all schemes at 0.9. --> <!-- -   We can see that the four schemes' ambition ranges between 0.91 (West Suffolk) and 0.76 (James Paget). these all fall in the range of average ambitions shown by all schemes (0.96 to 0.66). -->
-   Hillingdon has the most ambitious average parameter input at 0.66. The next highest is Watford at 0.75.

### Parameter certainty

-   The grouping with the largest proportion of high certainty assumptions is *Planned medical activity (adult)* (17, 34.0%) whilst the one with largest proportion of low certainty assumptions is *Emergency department and acute medicine activity* (78, 44.3%) <!-- -   Frimley and Leighton are near opposite ends of the schemes in terms of their average uncertainty range, with Frimley having an average interval width of 0.06 and Leighton 0.16. --> <!-- -   James Paget has shown the largest average uncertainty range in its selections (0.22) of all schemes, with the remaining three schemes being around the middle of all schemes and close clustered to one another (0.11 to 0.14) -->
-   Hillingon has the 7th highest certainty in its inputs, with an average range of 0.11

### NEE credibility

-   A large majority (72.9%) of all assumptions across all schemes are less ambitious than the NEE mid-point, with only 16.7% being as or more ambitious.
-   For each individual scheme that has model runs, a minority of its selections are as or more ambitious <!-- -   Frimley has the lowest proportion of its parameters meeting or exceeding NEE ambition of all schemes at only 2.9%, whilst Leighton is more middling with 20.0%. --> <!-- -   Of the four schemes, James Paget has the largest proportion inputs that are as or more ambitious (28.8%), whilst West Suffolk has the smallest (3.4%) -->
-   Hillingdon has the third highest proportion (34.3%) parameter inputs whose mid-points meet or exceed the ambition of the NEE mid-point.

### Baseline credibility

-   We can see that a majority of all parameters showed a weakly negative or positive correlation to the scheme's baseline position (53, 58.9%). This is surprising given that broadly we might expect a higher baseline position to correlate with more ambition (i.e. a negative correlation to the model input).
-   The only parameter groups which had a majority of their parameters' selections showing a moderately or strongly negative correlation was *Hospital activity amenable to psychiatric liaison and community psychiatry* (3, 75.0%) and *Emergency department and acute medicine activity* (14, 70.0%).

### Notable scheme assumptions:

<!-- -   Leighton has 42 unselected parameters which were used by at least half of all schemes, with some of these having been used by nearly all the schemes, e.g. Outpatient Convert to Tele-Attendance (Adult, Non-Surgical) was used by 15 schemes and Emergency Admission of Older People by 14. Frimley has 39, with, for example, Outpatient Followup Appointment Reduction (Children, Surgical) having been used by 14 of the 17 schemes. -->

<!-- -   Both schemes have two particularly ambitious parameters: for Frimley, these both come from Planned medical activity (adult) grouping, and for Leighton, from the Planned surgical activity (adult) grouping. -->

<!-- -   West Suffolk has 16 unselected parameters which were used by at least half of all the schemes -->

<!-- -   Hinchingbrooke has selected 2 parameters where their expectation is a 100% reduction in the associated activity -->

-   Hillingdon has 34 unselected parameters which were used by at least half of all schemes, with *Frail Elderly Admissions (Intermediate Frailty Risk)* having been selected by all 16 of the other schemes
-   It has 5 parameters whose inputs are signficantly more ambitious than its average. Each of these is set at 0.005, i.e. a 99.5% reduction.
-   

## Limitations / issues to note

-   In some cases schemes have selected parameters and inputted a value of 1 which is effectively the same as not selecting that parameter

## Possible further work

-   An assessment of the materiality of the schemes' unused parameters
-   We have not presented a baseline / time series analysis for the scheme-level analyses

# Annex: Methods and data sources

## Data sources

There are three broad data sources used in this analysis:

-   **Scheme inputs from the Demand and Activity Model** -- this includes one row per parameter and scheme (**909** total combinations), with information on the p10, p90 and mid-point for that particular parameter as well as the baseline and horizon year.
-   **NEE results** -- this provides information on the average p10 and p90 selected by subject matter experts as part of the NEE exercise for the **78** parameter included.
-   **Scheme historical activity rates** -- this provides the rates of activity falling in scope of parameter by scheme, financial year (from 2008-09 to 2022-23), and **90** parameters.

### National expert elicitation exercise

The NEE exercise was conducted in the autumn of 2023 as a way of gathering subject matter experts' (SMEs) views on the likely values that parameters in the Demand and Activity Model would take in the future at an England level. For example, SMEs might have indicated what they believed would be the impact of healthy life expectancy on hospital activity in the future.

The values provided by SMEs took the form of the the 10th and 90th percentiles (commonly known as the p10-p90 or 80% interval).

Efforts were taken to ensure that the SMEs' predictions were free from cognitive biases such as anchoring, availability, and representativeness, groupthink, overconfidence, and difficulties associated with communicating knowledge in numbers and probabilities.

The NEE exercise is considered pertinent to our analysis as for most of the parameters that have been set locally (78 out of 92), it provides a national-level view on which to consider the relative ambition that schemes have shown.

## Model horizons

Although all schemes are using the baseline of 2019-20, not all schemes have the same model horizon. Thus when comparing the schemes' inputs, the values are not necessarily like-for-like given that a sooner horizon indicates a faster yearly change, all other things being equal -- e.g. a 20% reduction in 10 years will be more dramatic than a 20% reduction in 20 years.

With one exception, this has not been controlled for: when considering the relationship between scheme's inputs and the historical 5-year trends, we have standardised both to be yearly values, assuming compounding growth (i.e. if a scheme has set a parameter at $x$ and the number of years between the baseline is $n$ , then the yearly value is calculated as $x^\frac{1}{n}$ .

## Assessment methodology

The table below outlines how our counts are calculated for each area of analysis. We have separate aggregations for the analysis by parameter and the analysis by scheme. The parameter-level analyses are presented over mitigatable activity group given there are 92 individual parameters.
