## Background

The government has committed to building more than 40 new hospitals by 2030. The New Hospital Programme (NHP), a partnership between Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS England (NHSE), aims to ensure that this new hospital infrastructure will meet the future needs of the population and that the required investment represents value for money.

Estimating future activity levels represents a critical early step in the process of scaling and designing new hospital infrastructure. The Strategy Unit (SU) has developed a Demand and Capacity (D&C) model to support the NHP and its stakeholders to make robust and auditable assessments of activity that hospitals may need to accommodate in the future.

## D&C model overview

The NHP D&C model takes activity at a chosen baseline year and projects into the future how activity levels might change without further action (though, importantly, assuming that past actions are sustained and scaled in line with population changes). It also allows systems to make judgements about evidence-based activity mitigations and productivity improvements that they plan to achieve (e.g. to reduce activity, lower its intensity, or divert it). From that combination of inputs, set as ranges to reflect uncertainty, the model forecasts a distribution of likely future activity. From that activity forecast, capacity requirements can then be derived.

The overall model logic is shown below (the elements in blue are currently live; the elements in orange are planned future refinements):

![](images/model%20diagram.png)

In developing the modelling approach for individual hospital schemes (as opposed to whole-programme average assumptions to drive e.g. the Programme Business Case), NHP has determined which input assumptions at the current time are best determined locally (following a systematic method, using a nationally determined structure- the NHP D&C model- and with constructive challenge) and which nationally. Assumptions are set nationally where there is little or no reason to believe that the factor is likely to operate differentially at a local level.

This is set out below:

+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Assumption                  | National / local                                |

: National and local assumptions

## Purpose of this report

The purpose of this report is to allow the NHP to assess the breadth, ambition, certainty and credibility of trusts' activity mitigator assumptions. These constitute the bulk of the local assumptions made by each trust during the model rollout / local elicitation exercises that have been conducted this year.

## Structure of the report

We consider lines of inquiry within this report as detailed in the below table. (Note that above NEE refers to the National Elicitation Exercise which was conducted in 2023 to ask subject matter experts their views on the likely reasonable ranges of change in the future for each of the mitigators in the model.)

## Mitigator in analysis 

The table below provides information on all the 92 mitigators considered in this paper, including their grouping, the activity type (i.e. inpatient admission, outpatient attendances and A&E attendances) and type (activity avoidance or efficiencies).

```{r mitigators_list}
mitigator_lookup |> 
  select(Grouping, 
         `Activity type`, 
         `Mitigator type`, 
         Mitigator = `Strategy name`) |> 
  knitr::kable(caption = "All mitigators in analysis")

```

## Schemes in analysis

The following schemes have completed the exercise.

```{r site_list}
nhp_tagged_runs_meta |> 
  mutate(create_datetime = as.Date(ymd_hms(create_datetime)),
         run_stage = str_to_title(str_extract(run_stage, "^[^_]+"))) |> 
  left_join(trust_code_lookup, 
            by = c("dataset" = "Trust ODS Code")) |> 
  select(Trust = `Name of Trust`,
         Site = `Name of Hospital site`,
         `Trust code` = dataset,
         `Run stage` = run_stage,
         Date = create_datetime) |> 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Sites that have completed exercise")
```

## Analyses

```{r mitigator_agg_data}

n_schemes <- nrow(nhp_tagged_runs_meta)
mitigator_agg_data <- dat |> 
  filter(!is.na(value_mid)) |> 
  summarise(n = n(),
            coverage = n / n_schemes,
            avg_lo = mean(value_lo),
            avg_mid = mean(value_mid),
            avg_hi = mean(value_hi),
            avg_certainty = mean(value_range),
            nee_p10 = mean(nee_p10),
            nee_mid = mean(nee_p50),
            nee_p90 = mean(nee_p90),
            .by = c(mitigator_group, mitigator_variable))
```

### Mitigator coverage

The table below shows the coverage of mitigator groups across the `r n_schemes` that have model runs. This is based on the number of times a given mitigator group appeared divided by the maximum given the number of schemes.

```{r mitigator_coverage}
mitigator_group_coverage <- mitigator_agg_data |> 
  group_by(mitigator_group) |> 
  summarise(mitigators_in_group = n(),
            incidence = sum(n),
            max_incidence = mitigators_in_group * n_schemes) |> 
  janitor::adorn_totals(name = "All groups") |> 
  mutate(coverage = incidence / max_incidence) 

mitigator_group_coverage |> 
  mutate(coverage=scales::percent(coverage)) |> 
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Mitigator group",
                             "Number of mitigators in group",
                             "Incidence across schemes",
                             "Max incidence across schemes",
                             "Coverage across schemes"),
               caption = "Coverage of mitigator groups across schemes")
  
```
### Relative ambition


When assessing the relative ambition of mitigators across schemes, we categorise the scheme inputs into three groups: low ambition (less than a 10% reduction), medium ambition (a 10% to 50% reduction), and high ambition (reduction of 50% or more).

The table shows, for each mitigator group, the proportion of scheme inputs which fall into each of these thresholds. We can see that across all mitigators 24 (3%) of scheme inputs were high ambition, 510 (56%) were medium ambition, and 375 (41%) were low ambition.

```{r mitigator_ambition}
mitigator_ambition_by_group <- dat |> 
  filter(!(is.na(value_mid))) |> 
  mutate(
    mitigator_ambition = case_when(
      value_mid > 0.9 ~ "low",
      value_mid > 0.5 ~ "med",
      value_mid <= 0.5 ~ "high",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_)) |> 
  count(mitigator_group, mitigator_ambition) 

mitigator_ambition_by_group |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = mitigator_ambition, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) |> 
  select(mitigator_group, high, med, low) |> 
  janitor::adorn_totals(name = "All groups") |> 
  mutate(total = high + med + low) |> 
  mutate(across(c(high, med, low, total),
                ~ paste0(.x, 
                         " (", 
                         scales::percent(
                           .x / total, 
                           accuracy = 1), ")"))) |> 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Number and proportion of scheme responses by group and ambition level",
               col.names = c("Mitigator group",
                             "High",
                             "Medium",
                             "Low",
                             "Total"))

```

### Relative certainty

When assessing mitigator certainty, we categorise scheme inputs into three groups: high certainty (an input range less than 0.05, including point estimates), medium certainty (an input range from 0.05 to 0.15), and low certainty (an input range of 0.15 and above).

The table below indicates that, across all groups, 268 (29%) of scheme inputs were highly certain, 316 (35%) were medium certainty, and 325 (36%) were low certainty.

```{r mitigator_certainty}
mitigator_certainty_by_group <- dat |> 
  filter(!(is.na(value_mid))) |> 
  mutate(
    mitigator_certainty = case_when(
      value_range < 0.05 ~ "high",
      value_range < 0.15 ~ "med",
      value_range >= 0.15 ~ "low",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_)) |> 
  count(mitigator_group, mitigator_certainty) 

mitigator_certainty_by_group |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = mitigator_certainty, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) |> 
  select(mitigator_group, high, med, low) |> 
  janitor::adorn_totals(name = "All groups") |> 
  
  mutate(total = high + med + low) |> 
  mutate(across(c(high, med, low, total),
                ~ paste0(.x, 
                         " (", 
                         scales::percent(
                           .x / total, 
                           accuracy = 1), ")"))) |> 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Number and proportion of scheme responses by group and certainty level",
               col.names = c("Mitigator group",
                             "High",
                             "Medium",
                             "Low",
                             "Total"))
```

### Credibility compared to NEE

The table below shows the counts of inputs by mitigator group across all schemes which were either as or more ambitious than the NEE midpoint for the mitigator or less ambitious than the NEE mid-point. It indicates that, across all mitigators, 152 (17%) were as or more ambitious than the NEE mid-point, and 663 (73%) were less ambitious, with the remainder (94,10%) not being covered in the NEE exercise.

```{r nee_credibility}
nee_credibility <- dat |> 
  filter(!is.na(value_mid)) |> 
  mutate(nee_diff = case_when(value_mid > nee_p50 ~ ">NEE",
                              value_mid <= nee_p50 ~ "<=NEE",
                              TRUE ~ "NEE_missing")) |> 
  count(mitigator_group, nee_diff)

nee_credibility |>

                ~ paste0(.x, 
                         " (", 
                         scales::percent(
                           .x / total, 
                           accuracy = 1), ")"))) |> 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Number and proportion of scheme responses by group and comparison to NEE mid-point",
               col.names = c("Mitigator group",
                             "As or more ambitious",
                             "Less ambitious",
                             "No NEE",
                             "Total"))
```
